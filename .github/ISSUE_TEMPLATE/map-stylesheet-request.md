## Style change requested
Describe what you want to see added or modified in the style. Is it something easy to explain like a color fill or rendering something not currently showing? Or is it a more complex need specific to historical mapping? 

If you're asking for new symbology, especially for historical points of interest or areas that might not be part of modern maps, are there existing cartographic symbols or standards we can reference? The more info you can provide here the better!
