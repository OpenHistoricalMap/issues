# OpenHistoricalMap Issues

OpenHistoricalMap.org relies on a number of different code repositories to run the website, map tiles, search, iD editor, Tasking Manager, timesliders, and more. Rather than filing issues on each of those repos (which would mean we'd all have to know which code drives which feature), we're filing all bugs and feature requests here, then on the dev team we'll figure out where the changes need to happen. You can see a list of all our forks of OSM tools [on our wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenHistoricalMap/Development).

We have a couple of issue templates to help structure your reports for bugs or new feature requests. 
* [Request a map style change](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/issues/new?assignees=vknoppkewetzel&labels=stylesheets&projects=&template=map-stylesheet-request.md&title=)
* [Report a bug](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=)
* [Request a feature](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

We're using [Projects](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/projects) to prioritize and track work on tech changes, map style updates, and content updates.

# Guidelines for Feedback
The Open Historical Map project is supported and maintained by contributions from a robust community. As of 2022, design and development is led by [GreenInfo Network](https://www.greeninfo.org), with [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) as a key partner for adapting and maintaining OSM infrastructure. As part of the OHM community, GreenInfo Network aspires to have a respectful discourse about design and feature changes proposed.

We have a process for welcoming comments and contributions. If you're ready to get going now, check out a few things below to effectively contribute to the discourse:

Have a concern about how to participate? Read and abide by our guides for providing feedback:
* We begin interactions by acknowledging that we are a community with complementary goals and that different views on the design are allowed to respectfully coexist.
* Share what works best for you while making space for someone to share their idea or experience.
* Make space for gaps in contributions. Waiting a few hours or days to respond may create room for someone who does not contribute as often to step in.
* Acknowledge learning and celebrate success. If there is something that is working really well, let's mention those things and celebrate them. We want to make sure we enhance the things that are working as much as we want to fix what may not be working for you.
* Stop and ask for clarification if you perceive something that might be confusing.

Looking to contribute ideas, or to support design exploration? Here are some guiding questions to use when posting your comments:
* What are the main issues the design is tackling?
* To what extent have the designs proposed made progress on the main issue?
* To what extent have the designs proposed made progress on what you are working on?
