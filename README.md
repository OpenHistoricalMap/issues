# OpenHistoricalMap Issues

OpenHistoricalMap.org relies on a number of different code repositories to run the website, map tiles, search, iD editor, Tasking Manager, timesliders, and more. Rather than filing issues on each of those repos (which would mean we'd all have to know which code drives which feature), we're filing all bugs and feature requests here, then on the dev team we'll figure out where the changes need to happen.

We have a couple of issue templates to help structure your reports for bugs or new feature requests. We're using [Projects](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/projects) to prioritize and track work on tech changes, map style updates, and content updates.

We'll also be using the Wikis in this repository for documentation of deployment and specifically how we manage map style changes or updates to the timeslider or other OHM-specific functionality.
